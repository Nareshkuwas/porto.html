<h1>The Best Movies According to Naresh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Inception is a mind-bending masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences more than a decade after its release. The film's complex story, stunning visual effects, and innovative approach to filmmaking have helped make it a modern classic</p>
<h3>The Hateful Eight</h3>
<p>The Hateful Eight is yet another brilliant entry of his flawless filmography, and it may even be one of the best he's ever done. It should be considered one of the all-time great Westerns because it just is, and the world of cinema is made better with its existence.</p>
<h3> Django Unchained</h3>
<p>It might not be the most innovative in Tarantino’s oeuvre, but it’s got real stakes and memorable characters one can root for. Django is packed with Tarantino’s postmodern trademarks, but it also has the added value of actually addressing serious issues.</p>
